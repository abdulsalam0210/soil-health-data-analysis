# soil-health-data-analysis
This project extracts soil nutrient data from India’s Soil Health Dashboard using Selenium. It involves scraping data for 2023–24 and 2024–25, consolidating macro/micro nutrient CSVs, and analyzing trends via EDA. The work reflects my own learning and effort without using AI-generated code.
